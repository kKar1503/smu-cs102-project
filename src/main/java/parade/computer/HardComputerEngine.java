/**
 * The HardComputer class represents an AI player with an advanced strategy. This AI minimises its
 * own losses while maximising the difficulty for the opponent. It uses predictive analysis to
 * determine the best card to play.
 *
 * <p>HardComputerEngine selects the best card to play by balancing two factors: - Minimising its
 * own loss (i.e., taking as few parade cards as possible). - Maximising the difficulty for the
 * opponent (i.e., forcing them into bad moves).
 *
 * <p>This engine simulates the loss it would incur for each possible move and also predicts how
 * much it can force the opponent to lose.
